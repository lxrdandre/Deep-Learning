This project is a deep learning image classifier built with PyTorch and ResNet-18.
It uses transfer learning to identify and distinguish between 17 different celebrities.
Trained on the Kaggle "Celebrity Face Image Dataset," the model was fine-tuned for this specific task.
The final classifier successfully achieves approximately 80% accuracy on the validation set.
