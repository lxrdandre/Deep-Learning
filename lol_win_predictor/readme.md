In this project I developed a deep learning model with an accuracy of 55% that can predict, based on your score and statistics from a League of Legends match if you won or lost the match. Given that winning a League of Legends match doesn't depend only on your statistics in a match, and being a team game, it is related to many more factors including your team's statistics, the achieved accuracy is the best that could be achieved for this dataset. I have trained, fine-tuned, evaluated the model and used Riot Games API to gather data from my League of Legends account. I selected the last 1000 games I've played. I've also saved the model's parameters, the old file has parameters for a 50.5% accuracy and the other pth file has the best parameters learned.
