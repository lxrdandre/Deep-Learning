In this project I developed waste classification model that can accurately differentiate between recyclable and organic waste
based on images. I have trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated the model using transfer learning, which can then be applied to a real-world
waste management processes.
The trained model can classify waste images into recyclable and organic categories.
