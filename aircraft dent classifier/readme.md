In this project, I built a classifier using Deep Learning with Keras that classifies aircraft damage, with a good accuracy, using a pre-trained VGG16 model and generates captions using a Transformer-based pretrained model. \
This model could be used in real-world scenarios to inspect the aircrafts before every flight to make sure they are ready for flight and are not damaged (they don\'92t have any dents or cracks).}
